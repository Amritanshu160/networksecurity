## Why schema.yaml file is created ??
## We need to compare the schema, we need to basically see how many no. of columns are there(numerical columns), through this we will be able to validate this entire data itself.
## We created schema.yaml --> it will be in form of key-value pairs
SCHEMA_FILE_PATH = os.path.join("data_schema", "schema.yaml") ## There will be a foldeer data_schema , inside this we will have schema.yaml file.
